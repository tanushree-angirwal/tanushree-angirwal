# 💫 About Me:
"I am a Final Year **B.B.A (Computer Applications)** student at **Abeda Inamdar Senior College** (Affiliated to **Savitribai Phule Pune University**) and an aspiring **Business Analyst**. I don’t treat data as static reports — I treat it as a **decision-making asset**. To me, data is storytelling with intent, where every metric answers a business question and every dashboard drives action.

My strength lies in bridging the gap between **raw data and strategic insight**. From architecting a **32-tab analytical data warehouse** in Google Sheets, to automating **ETL-style workflows for HR systems**, to designing **retention and churn dashboards** for fitness clients — my focus is consistent: **build reliable systems, eliminate guesswork, and enable smarter decisions through automation and structure**. I am deeply interested in analytics that create real impact, especially where efficiency, retention, and scalability matter."
